            <h2>Article 3: Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
            <p>2022-02-09</p>
            <p>Images are powerful. Understanding how to use images and visual material to complement a written story seems to unlock possibilities for critical thinking. When reading the New York Times article, I found myself analyzing the pictures shown, trying to interpret and develop my own narrative behind the pictures. Unfortunately the "What's going on with this picture?" link was broken, so I was not able to get the full description or caption of the images. However, it allowed me to be more exploratory with my ideas and use context clues to string together what was going on in each picture.
            </p>
            <p> After having read the New York Times article, I then went on the suggested Awwwards.com page to explore some websites there. I found myself to be interested in the visual components more than the topic themselves: the images and graphics allowed me to stay engaged longer. As a designer, I was interested in how these images were coded and incorporated into the website.</p>
            <p>Lastly, looking at these references and learning about visual learning strategies made me think a little about the upcoming studio project we have. I was thinking about what I wanted to do. Rather than the content, my focus lay on how I'd be able to weave images and a narrative to ceate an engaging story. </p>

            <h2>Article 2: Best Practices for Overlays </h2>
            <p>2022-01-07</p>
            <p>While reading the article, I realized how frequent the use of overlays and modal windows are in interactive media. I like how the article is able to decipher the specific uses of these modal windows, as it gives more clarity for me to better understand how and when to use them. I've come to interact with poorly implemented overlays and thus has resulted in a worse experience or understanding of the website/app being used. The worst use of these is the escape hatch. There are so many times when overlay windows have an escape hatch that is hard to identify or navigate, almost as if the window does want you to escape.</p>
            <p>One general piece of advice that I liked from the article was the recommendation to allow users to initiate these modal windows, rather than surprising them as if a form of advertisement.</p>

            <h2>Article 1: Form Design</h2>
            <p>2022-01-31</p>
            <p>Filling out an online form needs a lot of thought and design behind it. There is a lot of consideration I didn’t know about that was put behind designing forms, more specifically when looking and accessibility, usability, and the number of conversions. Getting a form’s UX to be smooth and encouraging for the user plays a big part in becoming a form that is filled out.</p>
            <p>One thing that stood out to me was in practice seven, how the author goes in-depth with talking about labels. Things such as the label position, the proximity and use of space between labels, and even inline labels save us space but prove to create a usability error as they disappear when being typed into</p>

            <p>A website that I like with regard to forms is the Paramount Career website. Filling out the forms as they use different elemenets and abide by some of the rules seen in the article.</p>
