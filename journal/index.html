            <date>2022-01-31</date>
            <p>Filling out an online form needs a lot of thought and design behind it. There is a lot of consideration I didn’t know about that was put behind designing forms, more specifically when looking and accessibility, usability, and the number of conversions. Getting a form’s UX to be smooth and encouraging for the user plays a big part in becoming a form that is filled out.</p>
            <p>One thing that stood out to me was in practice seven, how the author goes in-depth with talking about labels. Things such as the label position, the proximity and use of space between labels, and even inline labels save us space but prove to create a usability error as they disappear when being typed into</p>

            <p>A website that I like with regard to forms is the Paramount Career website. Filling out the forms as they use different elemenets and abide by some of the rules seen in the article.</p>
