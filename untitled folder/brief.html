            <h2>Project Summary 1</h2>
            <p>2023-02-07</p>
            <p>The project topic I have chosen to update is the Every Picture studio project. Previously, I was unable to add a javascript function, and focused more on the html and CSS. I wanted to add js elements and add more complex parts to the images themselves, maybe even restructuring my whole project.</p>
            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>More specifically, I want to use js to add moving elements on scroll so that the narrative aspect of my project is further enchanced.</p>
            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>I want to further model my design and visual construction so it resembles the most recent New York Times article that we took a look at in class. I'm still not sure what the visual hierarchy will be, as I'm unsure how I want to incorporate images and text within this project. I have a couple of ideas from example files we have worked on.</p>
            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>Most of the interactions withing this final project will revolve around the scroll feature: I want this project to really hone in on scrolly-telling. I might also try to incorporate other hover or click interactions that would enhance the story being told.</p>
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I want to create a story similar to a ribbon: I want it to unfold and reveal itself little by little. I am going to experiment and brainstomr more for how I can achieve this effect, but I want the smaller more minute details to be the highlight, rather than the larger picture.</p>
